I was preparing for the Olympiad of Informatics or Programming Contests.

Installing git-bash: [here](https://www.stanleyulili.com/git/how-to-install-git-bash-on-windows/)(On Windows)

Once installed you have to run the commands:

*Advice: Don't use CTRL + V on git bash terminal*

## Get the remote repository and create a local repository on your pc.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexEnac/algorithmic-problems/
```

## Get the changes

```bash
git pull origin
```
*use this after someone has made a change and commited to the remote repository*

## Git Status 
```bash
git status
```
*use this command to see if someone has made some changes on the remote repository*

## Adding files/changes to the remote repository
```bash
git add . //to add all the changes you made
git commit -m "message" // to commit the changes you've made
git push origin master //to push the files/changes to the remote repo
```
